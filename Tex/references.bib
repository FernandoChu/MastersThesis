  abstract  = {Dependent pattern matching is an intuitive way to write programs and proofs in dependently typed languages. It is reminiscent of both pattern matching in functional languages and case analysis in on-paper mathematics. However, in general it is incompatible with new type theories such as homotopy type theory (HoTT). As a consequence, proofs in such theories are typically harder to write and to understand. The source of this incompatibility is the reliance of dependent pattern matching on the so-called K axiom - also known as the uniqueness of identity proofs - which is inadmissible in HoTT. The Agda language supports an experimental criterion to detect definitions by pattern matching that make use of the K axiom, but so far it lacked a formal correctness proof. In this paper, we propose a new criterion for dependent pattern matching without K, and prove it correct by a translation to eliminators in the style of Goguen et al. (2006). Our criterion both allows more good definitions than existing proposals, and solves a previously undetected problem in the criterion offered by Agda. It has been implemented in Agda and is the first to be supported by a formal proof. Thus it brings the benefits of dependent pattern matching to contexts where we cannot assume K, such as HoTT. It also points the way to new forms of dependent pattern matching, for example on higher inductive types.},

  abstract  = {A family of syntactic models for the calculus of construction with universes (CCω) is described, all of them preserving conversion of the calculus definitionally, and thus giving rise directly to a program transformation of CCω into itself. Those models are based on the remark that negative type constructors (e.g. dependent product, coinductive types or universes) are underspecified in type theory-which leaves some freedom on extra intensional specifications. The model construction can be seen as a compilation phase from a complex type theory into a simpler type theory. Such models can be used to derive (the negative part of) independence results with respect to CCω, such as functional extensionality, propositional extensionality, univalence or the fact that bisimulation on a coinductive type may not coincide with equality. They can also be used to add new principles to the theory, which we illustrate by defining a version of CCω with ad-hoc polymorphism that shows in particular that parametricity is not an implicit requirement of type theory. The correctness of some of the models/program transformations have been checked in the Coq proof assistant and have been instrumented as a Coq plugin.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to outline an analysis and interpretation of the process that led to First-Order Logic and its consolidation as a core system of modern logic. We begin with an historical overview of landmarks along the road to modern logic, and proceed to a philosophical discussion casting doubt on the possibility of a purely rational justification of the actual delimitation of First-Order Logic. On this basis, we advance the thesis that a certain historical tradition was essential to the emergence of modern logic; this traditional context is analyzed as consisting in some guiding principles and, particularly, a set of exemplars (i.e., paradigmatic instances). Then, we proceed to interpret the historical course of development reviewed in section 1, which can broadly be described as a two-phased movement of expansion and then restriction of the scope of logical theory. We shall try to pinpoint ambivalencies in the process, and the main motives for subsequent changes. Among the latter, one may emphasize the spirit of modern axiomatics, the situation of foundational insecurity in the 1920s, the resulting desire to find systems well-behaved from a proof-theoretical point of view, and the metatheoretical results of the 1930s. Not surprisingly, the mathematical and, more specifically, the foundational context in which First-Order Logic matured will be seen to have played a primary role in its shaping.Mathematical logic is what logic, through twenty-five centuries and a few transformations, has become today.

We then construct a (weakly) universal Kan fibration, and use it to exhibit a model in simplicial sets. Lastly, we introduce the Univalence Axiom, in several equivalent formulations, and show that it holds in our model.
              
              As a corollary, we conclude that Martin-Löf type theory with one univalent universe (formulated in terms of contextual categories) is at least as consistent as ZFC with two inaccessible cardinals.},

  abstract = {Recent innovation in the design of type theories–foundational systems of mathematics with a focus on constructivity–has produced the concept of interval variable, which can be used to capture relations between objects that carry computational content. We examine two such relationships in type theory: equality, in particular quotients, and arbitrary relations as applied in parametricity interpretations.
              
              Cubical type theory, a system using an interval-based formulation of equality, enables a permissive kind of content-carrying equality that includes in particular isomorphism. Cubical type theory provides a constructive interpretation of homotopy type theory and the Univalent Foundations, formalisms that introduced the idea of isomorphism as equality but which lack intrinsic computational meaning. The cubical approach to equality also rectifies long-standing deficiencies in the behavior of quotients in type theory. We realize a system of generalized quotients for cubical type theory originally conceived in homotopy type theory, called higher inductive types, that merges the concepts of inductive type and quotient. Such a mutual generalization is particularly essential in the contentful equality setting, but also has significant applications to ordinary mathematics.
              
              Parametricity is, among other things, a proof technique for deriving properties of constructions performed in type theories, based on the idea that constructions preserve all relations between objects. Traditionally a meta-theoretical tool, recent work has shown that parametricity properties can be integrated into a type theory itself using an interval-based system. We develop internal parametricity on top of cubical type theory, examining the similarities and distinctions between the two applications of intervals, finding that a background of cubical equality improves the behavior of internal parametricity, and applying internal parametricity as a tool to solve difficult problems in cubical type theory. We introduce a system of cohesion modalities to express the interaction between parametric and non-parametric type theory, enabling the use of parametricity results in a non-parametric setting.},
